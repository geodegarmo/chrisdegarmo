<h3>Location of a Landslide in North Mills River During Hurricane Helene</h3>
<p>
A landslide occurred in the North Mills River area as a result of Hurricane Helene, with the following coordinates:

- Longitude: -82.6796575572448
- Latitude: 35.452981332010076
- Scale (approx. m/px): 2.388657133911758

Using high-resolution images from drone capture (see above video of the landslide), I analyzed the landslide and gathered the following observations:

- Area of the landslide: 19,226.4422 m²
- Perimeter length: 1,296.591 m

Mud residue on trees (December observation): Up to 6–9 feet (~1–3 meters) above the ground in the highest parts
Efforts to stabilize and repair the landslide slope have begun. These efforts likely include grading, erosion control, and reinforcement measures to prevent further movement. Continued monitoring and geospatial analysis will help assess the effectiveness of these mitigation efforts and the long-term stability of the site.
