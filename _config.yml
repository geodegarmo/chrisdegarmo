  4+ years as a Geospatial Analyst
  with extensive experience in remote sensing and landuse landcover. I’m currently pursuing a
  Master’s degree at the University of Oklahoma, further refining my skills and
  expertise in the field.
  <br><br>
  Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working with leading organizations
  like Wiser Imagery Services, MAXAR Technologies, Lockheed Martin, and The
  Climate Corporation. In these roles, I’ve honed expertise in spatial analysis,
  synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical imagery, machine learning,
  photogrammetry and geospatial workflows.
