Hello All,

My name is Chris DeGarmo, and I’m a Geospatial Research Scientist and Analyst
with extensive experience in geospatial technologies. I’m currently pursuing a
Master’s degree at the University of Oklahoma, further refining my skills and
expertise in the field. A fun fact about me is that I was recently selected by my
best friend Dr. Fredrico Kiffer to write a reference for his astronaut selection
candidacy. My reference helped him advance to the next round—a distinction
earned by only one in one hundred of thousands of candidates.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working with leading organizations
like Wiser Imagery Services, MAXAR Technologies, Lockheed Martin, and The
Climate Corporation. In these roles, I’ve honed expertise in spatial analysis,
synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical imagery, machine learning,
photogrammetry and geospatial workflows.

Beyond the technical skills, my passion for rock climbing and alpine expeditions
has sharpened my adaptability, problem-solving abilities, and meticulous planning
—qualities that I bring to my professional work.
